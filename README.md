## MISC

- Uses mongodb as primary db and redis(even for images) to cache, so the bot is pretty fast.
- NSFW commands can be enabled/disabled by admins.
- You won't be banned from WhatsApp unless you make the bot public, Just add the bot to your friends/family groups but nothing else.
- You can host the bot for free on Railway, 500 hours per month free. 

## SETUP
- Edit the .env file.
- Just watch a simple video on youtube to setup mongodb and change the db url.
- There are tons of guides on google on setting up Snoowrap for reddit.
- npm run start 
- Visit localhost:8080/qrcode, scan the qr and you're pretty good to go.
